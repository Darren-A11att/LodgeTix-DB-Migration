# E-Commerce Migration Summary

## Migration Completed Successfully ✅

### What Was Transformed

The MongoDB event registration system has been successfully transformed into a proper e-commerce model:

```
Old Model:                    New Model:
Registrations  ----------->   Carts → Orders
Events         ----------->   Products (type: 'product')  
Packages       ----------->   Products (type: 'multiPart')
Function       ----------->   Product (type: 'bundle')
Attendees      ----------->   (Preserved in metadata)
Tickets        ----------->   Cart Items (bundled products)
```

### Key Achievements

1. **Product Structure**
   - Created 1 bundle product: "Grand Proclamation 2025 Registration"
   - Converted 7 events to products
   - Converted 5 packages to multiPart products
   - Generated 12 variants (4 registration types × 3 attendee types)

2. **Cart Implementation**
   - Created 335 carts from registrations
   - Properly structured with:
     - Main bundle item (registration)
     - Separate cart items for purchased events (bundled products)
     - Parent-child relationships via `parentItemId`

3. **Order Processing**
   - Generated 308 orders from paid registrations
   - Preserved payment status (301 paid, 7 refunded)
   - Maintained all confirmation numbers
   - Retained payment processor details (Stripe/Square)

4. **Data Integrity**
   - 100% validation pass rate
   - All original data preserved in metadata
   - Proper ID mapping: eventId → product, eventTicketId → inventory

### Cart Structure Example

```javascript
Cart {
  cartId: "4a7a7ca5-ed7d-4251-b04a-b9169fde77a8",
  cartItems: [
    {
      // Main registration bundle
      cartItemId: "959ee583-ab9a-452e-9fe3-61d80e2d5f70",
      productId: "5ab51459-2bf3-4fc9-895b-09f3540938ec", // Bundle product
      variantId: "5ab51459-2bf3-4fc9-895b-09f3540938ec-6",
      quantity: 1,
      price: 180,
      metadata: {
        registrationType: "lodge",
        attendeeType: "guest"
      }
    },
    {
      // Bundled product (event ticket)
      cartItemId: "abc123...",
      productId: "68a466d4ea54206b6fb3cd7b", // Event product
      parentItemId: "959ee583-ab9a-452e-9fe3-61d80e2d5f70", // Links to bundle
      quantity: 10,
      price: 115,
      metadata: {
        eventName: "Grand Proclamation Banquet",
        isBundledProduct: true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Collections Created

- `products` - All products with variants and bundled products
- `carts` - Shopping carts with proper item structure
- `orders` - Completed purchases with payment details
- `inventory` - Stock management for events
- `registrationFormMappings` - Dynamic forms per variant

### Data Cleanup

- Removed 152 decomposed_ collections
- Preserved original data in old_ collections for reference
- Clean, normalized e-commerce structure

### Next Steps

The system is now ready for:
1. Building e-commerce UI components
2. Implementing checkout flow
3. Managing inventory and availability
4. Processing new registrations through the cart system
5. Generating reports and analytics
