### 2. 📦 Order Processing Workflow

### EnhancedDataTable Component

<EnhancedDataTable
  collection="orders"
  columns={columns}
  bulkActions={[
    { label: 'Print Labels', action: 'print_labels' },
    { label: 'Mark Fulfilled', action: 'mark_fulfilled' }
  ]}
  statusFilters={[
    { value: 'pending', label: 'Pending', count: 12 },
    { value: 'shipped', label: 'Shipped', count: 8 }

  expandedRow={(order) => <OrderDetails order={order} />}
/>
```

### Dashboard Metrics

- **Products**: Publish/unpublish, bulk delete
- **Inventory**: Mark low stock, reset quantities

## User Workflows Supported

### Daily Operations Flow
1. **Morning Check**: Dashboard shows overnight orders and issues
2. **Order Processing**: Filter pending orders → Select batch → Print labels → Mark fulfilled
3. **Inventory Check**: Low stock alerts → Review items → Create reorder
4. **Customer Service**: Quick search customer → View order history → Process refund

### Quick Actions Available
- **From Dashboard**: Process orders, add products, view reports
- **From Orders**: Print packing slips, send emails, issue refunds
- **Global Search**: Find any record instantly with Cmd+K

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Generic CRUD)
- ❌ Row-by-row editing only
- ❌ No workflow support
- ❌ No relationships visible
- ❌ No bulk operations
- ❌ No quick search
- ❌ No business metrics

### After (Enhanced Admin)
- ✅ Bulk operations for efficiency
- ✅ Status-based workflows
- ✅ Relationship display
- ✅ Dashboard with KPIs
- ✅ Global quick search
- ✅ Order processing pipeline

## Usage Examples

### Process Multiple Orders

## Technical Implementation

### Principles Followed
- **Extended existing code**: Enhanced DataTable rather than replacing
- **Simple patterns**: Reused Next.js conventions
- **Pragmatic features**: Only what's needed for today's operations
- **Minimal complexity**: Single component handles multiple use cases

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel API calls for dashboard metrics
- Debounced search with 300ms delay
- Limited results per collection (100 items)
- Lazy loading of expanded rows

## Next Steps (If Needed)
- Add pagination for large datasets
- Implement real-time updates with WebSocket
- Add email template management
- Create vendor commission reports
- Build customer segmentation tools
