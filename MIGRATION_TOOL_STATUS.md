# Migration Tool Status

## âœ… Fixed Issues

1. **API Connectivity**: Fixed the 404 error by updating the migration tool to use the correct Express server endpoints
2. **Search Endpoint**: Added POST `/api/collections/:name/search` endpoint to support finding related documents
3. **Document Creation**: Added POST `/api/collections/:name/documents` endpoint to create new documents
