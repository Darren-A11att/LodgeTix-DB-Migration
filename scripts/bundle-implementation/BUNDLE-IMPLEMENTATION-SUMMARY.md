## Sample Implementation

### Photography Pro Bundle Example
```javascript
{
  title: "Photography Pro Bundle",
  type: "bundle",
  
  // Required items (always included)
  bundle_items: [
    { title: "DSLR Camera", price: 1299.99 },
    { title: "Professional Lens", price: 799.99 }
  ],
  
  // Optional items with different behaviors
  optional_items: [
    {
      title: "Camera Bag Pro",
      optional_type: "opt_out",     // INCLUDED by default
      included_by_default: true,
      price: 149.99,
      description: "FREE bag - remove if not needed"
    },
    {
      title: "Extra Battery Pack",
      optional_type: "opt_in",      // NOT included by default
      included_by_default: false,
      price: 89.99,
      description: "Add for extended shooting"
    }
  ],
  
  discount_percentage: 20  // Bundle discount

## How to Use

### 1. Create a Bundle
```javascript
const BundleManager = require('./02-bundle-management-utilities');
const manager = new BundleManager();

await manager.connect();

const bundleId = await manager.createBundle({
  title: "Your Bundle Name",
  requiredItems: [...],
  optionalItems: [
    {
      title: "Free Gift",
      optionalType: "opt_out",  // Included by default
      price: 29.99
    },
    {
      title: "Premium Upgrade",
      optionalType: "opt_in",   // Not included by default
      price: 99.99
    }
  ],
  discountPercentage: 15
});
```

### 2. Add Bundle to Cart with Customer Selections
```javascript
// Customer selections (product_id -> include/exclude)
const selections = {
  "product_id_1": false,  // Customer opted out of this item
  "product_id_2": true    // Customer opted in to this item
};

await manager.addBundleToCart(cartId, bundleId, selections, quantity);
```

### 3. Update Bundle Selections in Cart
```javascript
// Customer changes their mind about optional items
const newSelections = {
  "product_id_1": true,   // Now wants the item they previously removed
  "product_id_2": false   // No longer wants this add-on
};

await manager.updateCartBundleSelections(cartId, itemIndex, newSelections);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Create More Bundles**: Use the BundleManager utility to create product bundles
2. **Integrate with UI**: Connect to your frontend for customer selection interface
3. **Set Up Fulfillment**: Configure how bundles are packed and shipped
4. **Analytics**: Track which optional items are most popular
5. **Pricing Strategy**: Optimize bundle discounts based on selections

The implementation is production-ready and fully supports the requested opt-in/opt-out functionality for bundle items.
