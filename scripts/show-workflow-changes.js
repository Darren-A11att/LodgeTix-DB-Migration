=== WORKFLOW CHANGES IMPLEMENTED ===

PREVIOUS WORKFLOW:
1. Import Square payments to staging
2. Import Supabase registrations to staging (bulk)
3. Process staged imports with matching
4. Generate invoices

NEW WORKFLOW:
1. Import Square payments to staging
2. Process staged imports with matching
3. Bulk import Supabase registrations (as backup)
4. Re-process staged imports (if new registrations found)
5. Generate invoices

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Bulk Supabase import now runs AFTER initial processing
✓ This ensures Square payments with matched registrations are processed first
✓ Bulk import acts as a backup to catch any missed registrations
✓ If new registrations are found, processing is re-run automatically
✓ All operations are logged to import_log collection

IMPORT LOG STRUCTURE:
{
  syncId: "SYNC-<timestamp>-<random>",
  startedAt: Date,
  completedAt: Date,
  status: "success" | "failed",
  success: {
    payments: [{ paymentId, objectId }],
    registrations: [{ registrationId, objectId }]
  },
  failures: [{ step, type, error, timestamp }],
  steps: [{ step, name, status, duration, itemsProcessed }],
  error: { message, stack, type } // if failed
}

TO RUN THE NEW WORKFLOW:
npm run dev

TO CHECK IMPORT LOGS:
node scripts/test-import-log.js
