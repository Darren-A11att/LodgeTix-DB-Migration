### 3. Unified Order Paradigm

Our research reveals a critical opportunity: implementing a **superordinate order schema** that treats all transaction types (registrations, sponsorships, merchandise, POS) as variants of a base order type. This provides:

- **Consistency**: Single source of truth for all financial transactions
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new order types without system changes
- **Reporting**: Unified analytics across all revenue streams
- **Compliance**: Single audit trail for all transactions

### 4. Feature Prioritization Framework

Based on our analysis, features are prioritized using:
```
Priority Score = Business Value × (11 - Technical Complexity) / 10
```

**Top Priority Features (Score 7.0+)**:
1. Decimal128 monetary values (9.0) - Financial integrity
2. Flexible ticket types (8.1) - Revenue optimization
3. Real-time inventory (8.0) - Prevent overselling
4. Automated reconciliation (7.2) - Operational efficiency
5. State machine workflows (7.2) - Process consistency
6. Multi-ticket support (7.2) - Group bookings

### 5. Competitive Differentiation

**Unique Value Propositions for LodgeTix:**
1. **Lodge-Specific Features**: Built for fraternal organizations, not generic events
