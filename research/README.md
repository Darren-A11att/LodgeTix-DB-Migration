## Key Insights

### 1. Financial Integrity is Paramount
- Always use `Decimal128` for monetary values
- Implement idempotency for all financial operations
- Create immutable audit trails
- Use transactions for multi-document consistency

### 2. Design for Flexibility
- Superordinate patterns allow multiple order types in one collection
- Discriminator fields enable type-specific logic
- Metadata fields provide extensibility
- Schema versioning handles evolution

### 3. Performance at Scale
- Strategic denormalization improves read performance
- Proper indexing is critical (compound, partial, text)
- Change streams enable real-time updates
- Aggregation pipelines handle complex queries

### 4. Industry Best Practices
- **From Stripe**: Idempotency, state machines, API design
- **From Shopify**: Multi-channel, inventory, metafields
- **From BigCommerce**: B2B hierarchies, performance optimization

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Financial foundation (Decimal128, audit trails)
2. **Phase 2**: Superordinate order schema
3. **Phase 3**: Data migration from existing collections
4. **Phase 4**: Integration and optimization

## Research Methodology

This research was conducted through:
- Analysis of public APIs and documentation
- MongoDB best practices and case studies
- Industry whitepapers and technical blogs
- Real-world implementation patterns
