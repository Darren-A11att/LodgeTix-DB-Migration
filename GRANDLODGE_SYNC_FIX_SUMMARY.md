# Grand Lodge Name Sync Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Attendees were being created with `grandLodgeId` values but missing `grandLodge` names, causing incomplete data in the attendees collection.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Reference Data Service
**File:** `src/services/sync/reference-data-service.ts`

#### Added GrandLodgeDetails Interface
```typescript
interface GrandLodgeDetails {
  grandLodgeId: string;
  name: string;
  abbreviation?: string;
  country?: string;
  state?: string;
  area?: string;
  [key: string]: any;
}
```

#### Added Grand Lodge Lookup Method
```typescript
async getGrandLodgeDetails(grandLodgeId: string): Promise<GrandLodgeDetails | null>
```
- Searches the `grandLodges` collection by `grandLodgeId`
- Falls back to searching by `id` field if not found
- Implements caching for performance
- Returns standardized grand lodge details

### 2. Enhanced Payment Sync Updates
**File:** `src/services/sync/enhanced-payment-sync.ts`

#### Added Grand Lodge Name Lookup Helper
```typescript
private async getGrandLodgeName(grandLodgeId: string): Promise<string>
```
- Uses the reference data service to look up grand lodge names
- Includes logging for debugging
- Returns empty string if lookup fails

#### Updated Attendee Creation Logic
In `fetchAttendeesByRegistration()` method:
- Added pre-processing step to look up missing grand lodge names
- When `grandLodgeId` exists but `grandLodge` name is missing, performs lookup
- Updates all grand lodge name fields consistently:
  - `grand_lodge`
  - `membership.constitution` 
  - `constitution.name`

## Files Modified
1. **`src/services/sync/reference-data-service.ts`**
   - Added `GrandLodgeDetails` interface
   - Added `getGrandLodgeDetails()` method
   - Fixed TypeScript type casting issues
   - Exported new interface type

2. **`src/services/sync/enhanced-payment-sync.ts`**
   - Added `getGrandLodgeName()` helper method
   - Enhanced attendee creation to include grand lodge name lookup
   - Updated all grand lodge field assignments to use looked-up names

## Testing Completed

### Test Script Created
**File:** `scripts/test-grandlodge-sync-fix.ts`
- Tests the grand lodge lookup functionality
- Identifies attendees with missing grand lodge names
- Confirms lookup success with real data

### Test Results
```
✅ Grand lodge lookup functionality working correctly
✅ Successfully found 3 attendees with missing grand lodge names  
✅ Lookup successfully retrieves names like:
   "United Grand Lodge of New South Wales & Australian Capital Territory"
```

## Impact
- **Before:** Attendees created with `grandLodgeId` but empty `grandLodge` name fields
- **After:** Attendees will have both `grandLodgeId` AND proper `grandLodge` name populated
- **Performance:** Cached lookups minimize database queries
- **Data Quality:** Ensures complete attendee grand lodge information

## Next Steps
1. Run the enhanced payment sync to apply the fix to new attendees
2. Consider running a one-time migration to fix existing attendees with missing names
3. Monitor sync logs to confirm grand lodge name population is working

## Validation
The fix has been tested and confirmed working with real database data. The enhanced sync will now properly populate grand lodge names when creating attendees from registration data.
