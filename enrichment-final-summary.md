# Attendee Enrichment Final Summary

## Overall Results
- **Total Attendees**: 352
- **Successfully Enriched**: 350 (99.43%)
- **Unable to Enrich**: 2 (0.57%)

## Enrichment Process Summary

### Phase 1: Initial Enrichment (318 attendees)
- Successfully enriched attendees from registrations with standard `attendees[]` array format
- Used data from `registration_imports` and `registrations` collections
- Mapped primaryEmail → email, primaryPhone → phone
- Added complete membership data

### Phase 2: Primary/Additional Format Extraction (32 attendees)
- Discovered 19 registrations using `primaryAttendee` and `additionalAttendees` format
- Successfully extracted and updated all 32 attendees from these registrations
- All primary attendees now have complete data
- Guest attendees have `contactPreference: primaryattendee` (contact via primary attendee)

### Remaining 2 Unenriched Attendees
These attendees cannot be enriched because their registrations don't exist in Supabase:

1. **Brian Samson** (01982f25-2275-71cf-8cd2-bcb42bec5fcf)
   - Registration: 755cd600-4162-475e-8b48-4d15d37f51c0 (IND-241525JY)
   - Status: Registration not found in Supabase

2. **Peter Goodridge** (01982f35-0dfe-73be-961a-02441d65840d)
   - Registration: 8169f3fb-a6fb-41bc-a943-934df89268a1 (IND-176449HG)
   - Status: Registration not found in Supabase

## Data Quality Summary

### After Enrichment:
- **Missing Email**: 7 attendees (all are guests with contactPreference: primaryattendee)
- **Missing Phone**: 7 attendees (same guests)
- **Complete Lodge Data**: All mason attendees have lodge and grand lodge information
- **Contact Preferences**: All attendees have appropriate contact preferences set

## Recommendations

1. **No Further Action Required** for the 350 enriched attendees - they have all available data
2. **Investigate** the 2 missing registrations with business team - likely deleted or test data
3. **Guest Contact Pattern** is correct - guests without email/phone use primary attendee for contact

## Technical Notes

The enrichment required handling two different registration formats:
1. Standard format: `registrationData.attendees[]` array
2. New format: `registrationData.primaryAttendee` + `registrationData.additionalAttendees[]`

Both formats are now properly handled and all available data has been extracted.
